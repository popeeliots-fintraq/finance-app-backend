    Updates the core ML logic for dynamic baseline adjustment using the EFS. [cite: 2025-10-20]
    
    This function simulates how the EFS factor adjusts the 'minimal acceptable' 
    spending baseline for core variable categories, helping to identify "leaks" (overspending 
    relative to need). [cite: 2025-10-15, 2025-10-20]
